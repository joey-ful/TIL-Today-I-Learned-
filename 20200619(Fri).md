## Cloud Infrastructure

- After choosing the cloud service model and the cloud type, customers need to plan the infrastructure architecture 

- The infrastructure layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data centers

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 18 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225690-f23ed500-b40d-11ea-91e1-99d943e2eb87.png)

### Cloud Region

- A geographic area or location where a Cloud provider's infrastructure is clustered under names like NA South or US East
- Clour Regions are isolated from one another to prevent being collapsed all at once by natural disasters.
- Distributed around the world so that customers can choose a region closest to them for lower network latency
- Each cloud region can have multiple zones



### Availability Zones

- Logical building blocks that make up a cloud region
- Distinct Data Centers with their own power, cooling and networking resources
- Names are like DAL-09 or us-east-1



### Cloud Data Centers

-  A huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure (everything that a physical IT environment has)
-  On-premise hardware

## Virtualization

#### Definition

- The process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something
- Ex. virtual applications, servers, storage and networks
- Effective way to reduce IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility __vmware.com



#### Hypervisor

- A virtual machine monitor (VMM)

- Computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines

- Manages resources that are allocated to VMs

  - Host machine - a computer on which a hypervisor runs

  - Guest machine - virtual machine running on a host machine

    


##### Type1 (Bare Metal) [source](https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/feature/Whats-the-difference-between-Type-1-and-Type-2-hypervisors#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20Type,on%20top%20of%20an%20OS.&text=The%20physical%20hardware%20that%20a,are%20collectively%20called%20guest%20machines)



![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 19 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225693-f3700200-b40d-11ea-8e0e-3443dc6b99cc.png)

  - Runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware
    - Don't need to load an underlying OS first
    - Most efficient and best-performing for enterprise computing.
    - Highly secure - logical isolation of every guest VM against malicious software and activity
  - Ex. VMware, ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-v

  

##### Type2 (Hosted Hypervisor)

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 19 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225695-f965e300-b40d-11ea-8f4f-82a6ef7f3f30.png)

- Installed on top of an existing OS
- Called a hosted hypervisor because it relies on the host machine's pre-existing OS
  - Unavoidable latency becuase all the hypervisor's activities and the work of every VM have to pass through the host OS
  - Security flaws or vulnerabilities in the hose OS could potentially compromsie all of the VMs running above it
  - Reserved for client or end-user systems where performance and security are lesser concerns
- Ex. VMware Fusion, Oracle VM VirutalBox, Parallels and VM Workstation



### Virtual Machine [source](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine)

- A physical server dedicated to a single-tenant

  - the tenant can optimize the server according to its needs for performance, security, and reliability

- Advantages

  - Performance predictability

- Stable - perfect for processing large volumes of data

  - Direct access to ther server and ability to leverage all underlying hardware architecture (root access allows more software options)
  - root access is not possible with a Bare Metal Hypervisor

## Secure Networking in Cloud

### Network in the cloud

- To create a network, need to define the size of the network (the IP address range)
- Cloud networks are deployed in networking spaces
- Networking spaces are separated segments of the networks using options e.g. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

#### Virutal Private Cloud

- Security of Private cloud
- Scalability of Public cloud

- VPCs can be divided into smaller segments called **subnets**

  ![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 19 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225701-ff5bc400-b40d-11ea-8dda-f3304919ff13.png)
  
#### Subnets

- Cloud resources (VMs, storage, network connectivity, load balancers, etc) are deployed into subnets

- Subnets allow users to deploy enterprise applications using the same multi-tier concepts used in on-premise environments

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 19 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225702-fff45a80-b40d-11ea-8418-7dc375d578eb.png)

- Main area where security is implemented in the cloud

- Every subnet is protected by **Access Control Lists (ACLS)** that serve as a subnet-level-fire wall.

- Within the subnet, one could created **Security Groups (SGs**) that provide security at the instance level such as VSIs

#### Add VSIs and storage to run applications

##### For a 3-tier application that require web access VISs, applications tier VISs and backend database VSIs

- Place the web facing VSIs into one SG

  - Need internet access
  - A public Gateway insatance is added to the network to enable users' access to the application

  - Enterprises prefer extending their on-premises resources to the cloud by securely connecting them using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 20 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225705-008cf100-b40e-11ea-95e7-dcbf6fa6f40a.png)

  - When building many subnets and deploying several workloads, Load Balancers are used to ensure the applications' responsiveness

- Application VSIs in a second SG
- Database VSIs in a third SG



## Containers

- An executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies

- It can be run anywhere (desktop, traditional IT, cloud)

- Small, fast, portable

- Leverages the features and resouces of the host OS >> Does not require a guest OS

  

  P.S. Comparison with Bare Metal Server

## Cloud Storage

- Where data and files are saved in the cloud

- Could require attachment to a compute node or access through internet

- Could access through public internet or a dedicated private network connection

- Provide scalability of data

- Four main types of storage

  - Direct Attached

    - Local storage that is fast and normally only used to store a server's operating system.

    - Ephemeral(only lasts as long at the computer resource it's attached to)

    - Cannot be shared with other nodes

    - Resilient to failure

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 20 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225716-0551a500-b40e-11ea-9afc-05e94772da0b.png)

  - File Storage

  - Block Storage

  - Object Storage

- Backup File and Block storage

  - Snapshot
  - A point in time image of the storage
  - Fast to create, don't require downtime, and subsequent snapshots only record changes to the data

## File Storage

![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 22 20 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52592748/85225718-05ea3b80-b40e-11ea-84ad-7a2096d2d24f.png)

- NFS (Network File System) Storage, the storage that is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network

- Common-place but slower than direct-attached and block

- Lowever cost than direct-attached and block storage

- Can be mounted or used on multiple servers at once

- Simple, straightforward

- Fit for organizing data in a hierarchical folder structure

  

## Block Storage

- Compute nodes using high-spped fibre connections	
  - Much faster read and write speeds
  - More expensive to build
- Only attach to one node at a time
- Suitable for use with databases and other applications where disk speed is important
- Break files into blocks (chunks) of data and store each block separately



## Object Storage

- Not attached to a compute node
- accessed via an API
- The cheapest and the slowest IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) means how quickly data can be read from or written to the storage
- Infinite in size to the end user
- Just pay for what you use because it never fills up
- Fit for unstructure data types, large and small, including documents, video, logs, backups, data fro IoT, application binaries and virtual machine images
- Stored in buckets in a structurally flat way
- Not suitable for running operating systems, nor applications such as databases where contents change



## Content Delivery Networks

- A distributed server network that accelerates Internet content delivery
- Content delivery network endpoints are placed in as many locations around the world as possible
- Store contents in distributed locations and reduces the distance between website visitors and server
- Increase the speed
- Reduce the amount of traffic
- Increase security through obscurity

## Hybrid Multicloud

- Leverage the best of cloud models and services
- Applications and workloads run across multiple different clouds
- Hybrid - connects to a private cloud and public cloud into a single infrastructure
- Multi - embrace a mix of cloud models from different service providers

## Microservices

- Own stack running on their own containers

- Communicate with one another over a combination of API's event streaming and message brokers

- Efficient application components development by multiple developers

- Teams can use different stacks and runtime environments for different components

- Componenets facing too much load can be scaled independently

  

## Serverless Computing

- An approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks

- Doesn't mean there are no servers

- Only the management of the underlying physical or virtual server is removed

- No provisioning of servers

- Run code on-demand, scaling as needed

- Never pay for idle capacity

- Abstracts the infrastructure away from developers

  

## Cloud Native Application

- Applications built or refactored to work in the cloud environment

- Consist of microservices working together as a whole to comprise an application (can run anywhere)

- Possible to make frequent, iterative improvements

  

## DevOps on the Cloud

- Development  + Oeration

- A collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in **quick iterative cycles**
- Apply agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders
- Reduce overhead, duplication, and rework
- Make building and running applications more managealbe my tackling complexities of cloud



## Application Modernization

- Architecture
  - Monoliths >> SOA(Service-Oriented Architecture) >> Microservice
- Infrastructure
  - Physical server >> Virtual machine >> Cloud
- Delivery
  - Waterfall >> Agile >> DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)
- Benefits
  - Accelerate digital transformation
  - Leverage new tech & services
  - Respond faster to change
