# Markwon syntax

### 1. Table of Contents
- `[Text to display](#title)`
- Spaces are replaced by '-' (Tabs are not replaced by '-')
- '.', '-', ':' are ignored
- Capital letters are changed to lowercase
- Regardless of hearders, the link of the title begins with a '#'
- A [site](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/) that generates Table of Contents is helpful but not always correct
- Example:<br>
   - Let's say there's a markdown like below
     > # TOC
     > ## 1. What is TOC
     > TOC is Table of Contents
     > ## 2. How to make TOC
     > Change uppercase to lowercase
     
  - Let's make TOC with the markdown above
    ```
    **Table of Contents**
    
    [TOC](#toc)
    
    1. [What is TOC](#1-what-is-toc)
    
    2. [Making TOC](#2-how-to-make-toc)
    ```


**Table of Contents**

[TOC](#toc)
    
1. [What is TOC](#1-what-is-toc)
    
2. [Making TOC](#2-how-to-make-toc)
