### AND OR Operators
a = 2;
b = 2;

`c = a = 2 && b + 1 = 3`

then `c = 1` because `1 AND 1` is 1.
I had no idea that these operators could be used with equations instead of ones and zeroes.
It's actually quite obvious, but it just never came to my mind.
These operations seem very useful in writing concise code lines.
