### What is Node.js
When, for example, modifying web page lists, html requires each page to be modified one by one.
However, Node.js does the work with a single change.
This is because instead of saving all the web pages, 
Node.js executes the program to build the pages everytime users request them.

Moreover, Node.js enables web users to create and modify web pages
allowing them to post their own contents online.
(So do php, jsp, jango, ruby, etc)

### Node.js runtime
Use JavaScript language to execute Node.js runtime to make Node.js Application

### Web Server
Enter address at Web Browser to request Web Server
Examples of Web Servers are Apache, Nginx, etc
Node.js can also be used a Web Server with extra functions.
It can send modified data to users with program editing.
